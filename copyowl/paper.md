Leading AI Agents: From Delegation to Orchestration
Abstract
The rapid development and deployment of AI agents have transformed various sectors, presenting both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the evolution from delegation to orchestration in AI agent management, highlighting the importance of secure and efficient frameworks to harness the full potential of AI while addressing critical issues such as authorization, accountability, and coordination. We review recent advancements in authenticated delegation frameworks and propose a comprehensive orchestration architecture that integrates diverse AI agents and data sources to optimize enterprise workflows.
Introduction
AI agents have become integral to modern digital ecosystems, performing tasks ranging from simple automation to complex decision-making. However, as their prevalence increases, so do the challenges related to their management and integration. Delegation, the process of assigning tasks to AI agents, is a fundamental step. However, orchestration, which involves coordinating multiple agents to achieve collective goals, is becoming increasingly crucial. This paper aims to provide an overview of the transition from delegation to orchestration in AI agent management, discussing relevant frameworks and architectures.
Delegation in AI Agents
Delegation in AI involves assigning specific tasks to agents while ensuring they operate within defined boundaries. One significant advancement in this area is the development of authenticated delegation frameworks. Tobin South et al. (2025) proposed a novel framework that extends existing identification and access management protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, to enable secure delegation of authority to AI agents. This framework allows human users to delegate tasks to AI agents while maintaining clear chains of accountability and controlling permissions through token-based mechanisms.
Promise Theory: A Modern Framework for Delegation
Promise theory is a formal framework that models interactions between autonomous agents based on voluntary commitments rather than enforced obligations. In this model, each agent is independent and only promises to carry out its own actions. This approach fosters trust, accountability, and flexible cooperation, drawing parallels with philosophical concepts of autonomy and social studies insights on distributed leadership.
Orchestration of AI Agents
While delegation focuses on individual tasks, orchestration involves coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex goals. Eser Kandogan et al. (2024) introduced a blueprint architecture for orchestrating AI agents and data in enterprise applications. This architecture uses the concept of 'streams' to coordinate the flow of data and instructions among agents. It includes an 'agent registry' for managing agent metadata and a 'data registry' for accessing proprietary data. The architecture also incorporates planners to break down tasks and optimize workflows based on quality of service (QoS) requirements.
Tools for AI Orchestration
Effective AI orchestration requires robust tools to manage and optimize the deployment and operation of AI systems. Some leading tools include:
Smyth OS: A platform that allows users to design and deploy AI agents using a no-code, drag-and-drop interface, supporting a wide range of integrations.
Kubernetes: An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, particularly useful for managing microservices and distributed applications.
Apache Airflow: An open-source tool for orchestrating complex computational workflows and data processing pipelines, ideal for setting up and managing data pipelines required for feeding data into AI models.
LangChain: A platform for building and managing AI workflows, particularly useful for integrating large language models and other AI components into cohesive systems.
Challenges and Future Directions
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. One key issue is the need for standardized scope definitions for common AI agent tasks. Additionally, privacy-preserving delegation mechanisms and tools for managing agent authentication policies are essential for broader adoption. In the context of orchestration, optimizing workflows to balance cost, accuracy, and latency remains an open problem. Future research should focus on developing unified architectures that support dynamic tool chaining and various planning strategies.
Conclusion
The transition from delegation to orchestration in AI agent management represents a significant shift towards more complex and coordinated AI systems. While existing frameworks provide a solid foundation for secure delegation, the proposed orchestration architectures offer a vision for integrating diverse AI agents and data sources to achieve collective goals. Addressing the remaining challenges will be crucial for the safe and productive integration of AI into various sectors.

The concept of leading AI agents has evolved from simple delegation to more complex orchestration, reflecting the growing sophistication of AI systems and their increasing integration into various domains. Delegation, as described in Goldszmidt and Yemini (1995), involves dispatching programs to remote processes for execution, allowing for decentralized network management. This approach provides flexibility and scalability in managing remote elements and domains (Goldszmidt & Yemini, 1995).

However, as AI agents become more advanced, the paradigm is shifting towards orchestration. Orchestration, as defined in Abbott et al. (2015), involves the mobilization of intermediaries on a voluntary basis to pursue joint governance goals. Unlike delegation, which relies on hard 'contractual' control, orchestration employs soft control through material and ideational support (Abbott et al., 2015). This shift is particularly evident in human-agent collaborations, where designers must consider factors such as code-of-conduct, task delegation, autonomy and control, intelligibility, common ground, and offering/requesting help (Cila, 2022).

The transition from delegation to orchestration in AI leadership presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, orchestration can lead to improved task performance and satisfaction in human-AI collaborations (Hemmer et al., 2023). On the other hand, it requires careful consideration of trust, task types, and AI anthropomorphism (Song et al., 2023). As we move towards more sophisticated AI systems, the focus should be on developing effective orchestration strategies that balance AI capabilities with human expertise, while addressing concerns related to control, trust, and ethical considerations.
